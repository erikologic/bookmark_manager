# About C.R.U.D

### What is C.R.U.D?
- This acronym represents the four basic functions of persistent storage and stands for **create, read, update and delete**.
- It corresponds to the **add, change, delete** paradigm with the added idem potent option of viewing or reading the data too.

### What is SQL?
- Stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is an old, still commonly used language to interact with databases.
- Its commands correspond to the set of operations possible on a relational database.

### SQL - Create

This command will create new rows in a table.
Where teh column names (fields) are declared, we omit ID. This is because the ID value is generated by SQL.
When passing strings to populate the rows, we use single quotes. SQL typically reserves double quotes for table names.
```
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');

```

### SQL - Read

If you use the SELECT * FROM filename method, it shows all columns.

```
SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;
```

### SQL - Update
```
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

### SQL - Delete
```
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste' AND ContactName='Maria Anders';
```
